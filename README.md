# Reverse mutations and evolutionary emergence

This theoretical study examines the role of reverse mutations in shaping the evolutionary emergence of pathogens within heterogeneous host populations comprising both susceptible and resistant genotypes. The proposed mathematical framework explicitly incorporates forward and reverse mutations in the pathogen, thereby allowing for the possibility of overcoming or failing to overcome host resistance. Within this context, the model quantifies the probability of pathogen emergence as a function of key epidemiological and ecological parameters.

This repository gathers all the scripts (Python) used to carry out our study on reverse mutations and their effects on the evolutionary emergence of pathogens.

- Fig1: Probability of emergence as a function of the fraction of resistant hosts in the
mixture, for n = 1 type of resistant host.
- Fig2: Probability of emergence (P) as a function of the model parameters, with and
without reverse mutations for a defined set of parameters. 
- Fig3: Probability of emergence (P) as a function of the model parameters, with and
without reverse mutations for a defined set of parameters. 
- Fig4: Probability of emergence (P) as a function of the model parameters, with and
without reverse mutations for a defined set of parameters. 
- Fig5: Whether reverse mutations challenge, promote or have no
significant impact on evolutionary emergence, in the parameter space (Î¼, c).
