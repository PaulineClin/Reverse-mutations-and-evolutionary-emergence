# Reverse-mutations-and-evolutionary-emergence
This repository gathers all the scripts (Python) used to carry out our study on reverse mutations and their effects on the evolutionary emergence of pathogens.

- Fig1: Probability of emergence as a function of the fraction of resistant hosts in the
mixture, for n = 1 type of resistant host.
- Fig2: Probability of emergence (P ) as a function of the model parameters, with and
without reverse mutations for a defined set of parameters. 
- Fig3: Probability of emergence (P ) as a function of the model parameters, with and
without reverse mutations for a defined set of parameters. 
- Fig4: Probability of emergence (P ) as a function of the model parameters, with and
without reverse mutations for a defined set of parameters. 
- Fig5: Whether reverse mutations challenge, promote or have no
significant impact on evolutionary emergence, in the parameter space (Î¼, c).
